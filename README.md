# Deliverable

## Function declaration
public functions that are never called by the contract should be declared external to save gas.
Functions: ShortOTokenActionWithSwap.sol / closePositions()

## Length of array in a loop
The length of an array should not be declared in a for-loop header
OpynPerpVault.sol / setActions(), totalStakedaoAsset(), closePositions(), rollOver()

## Add Immutable State Variables
Token addresses such as  `ecrv`, `weth` should be defined as Immutable
OpynPerpVault.sol / line 81
ShortOTokenActionWithSwap.sol / line 54, 57

## Version Upgrade
Starting from solidity version 0.8.0, arithmetic operations revert on underflow and overflow. So thereâ€™s no more need to use Safemath library.
Using built-in arithmetic will be less expensive than Safemath function calls.
